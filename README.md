# Employee Creator

## Introduction
This is a web application to create, list, modify and delete employees. The application consists of a spring
RESTful API and a React Typescript frontend. The schema for
the employee was provided in specs for this project. 
the purpose of this project is to demonstrate my understanding of writing RESTful APIs in Java and frontend using React Typescript.

## The tech stack I used
This is a fullstack application. I used:
- Java Spring Boot: Java Spring Boot is a powerful Java framework that makes it easy to develop high-performing, production-ready applications. 
Spring Boot provides a variety of features that make it easy to build, test, and deploy applications.
- React: ReactJS is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
It provides a virtual DOM that can update in real-time, making it an ideal choice for single-page applications.
- TypeScript: TypeScript provides strong typing, making it easier to catch errors before they make it to production.
- SCSS: With its ability to easily nest styles and write complex selectors, SCSS was the ideal choice for styling this application.
- MySQL: MySQL provides robust data storage and retrieval capabilities.

## Compiling and running the app
1. Clone the repo to your own device
